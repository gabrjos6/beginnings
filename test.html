  <div align="center" style="font-size:24px; font-family:monospace;">
    There's a better way to use HTML files: with an index. 
    <br> An index file (index.html) is the index of the folder, or if the repository/main folder has no child folders, it's the index of the main repo/folder.
    <br> So when you name an HTML file <i>index.html</i>, the URL becomes
    <a href="https://gabrjos6.github.io/beginnings/">gabrjos6.github.io/beginnings/</a> without the <i>test.html</i>.
  </div>
  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
  <div align="center" style="font-size:12px; font-family:monospace;">
    Actually, it's all up to taste. I prefer this over beginnings/test.html, but you can change it back. Just rename <i>index.html</i> to test.html and delete this.
