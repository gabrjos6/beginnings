  // Hai. I figured it out. It was through email. *facepalm*
  // So now I have push access to this repo (repository) and I can make commits.
  // First I thought I'd show you how to link your Javascript files to the html document. As you found out, the prompt() was not working, because it was not associated with the test.html file.
  // To link it, you need the script tag with the src attribute. It looks like this:
  // Alternatively, you can simply pop your javascript lines into the script tag itself, like the script tag right after the head tag ends. The default scripting lanugage in HTML5 is Javascript, but in older versions you would've had to do this: <script type="text/javascript"></script> or your desired scripting language.
