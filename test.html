    There's a better way to use HTML files: with an index. 
    <br> An index file (index.html) is the index of the folder, or if the repository/main folder has no child folders, it's the index of the main repo/folder.
    <br> So when you name an HTML file <i>index.html</i>, the URL becomes
    <a href="https://gabrjos6.github.io/beginnings/">gabrjos6.github.io/beginnings/</a> without the test.html.
